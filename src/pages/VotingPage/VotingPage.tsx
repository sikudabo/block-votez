                The future is NOW, and Marion needs a leader who has vision, new ideas, fresh energy, and dares to move forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marion has been on a consistent 15-year decline. A few contributors to this decline are major manufacturing jobs relocating, mass exodus of population, and the lack of employment opportunities that are attractive to younger generations. The decrease in these three areas have resulted in Marion having a lower than desirable operating budget which has prevented the ability to expend funds on quality of life and improvements.

                I am a minority Republican with experience in launching and running businesses, uniting the community around a common cause and growing organizations. These experiences have taught me to be innovative, which is the very skill needed to move our city forward.
                As a lifelong Marion resident, I have been taught to always make Marion first. I am running on the backs of many generations that have dedicated their lives to serving our community. As Mayor I will lead our community into the future, not bound by the past but reaching forward to new upward marks.

                Marion Reads will aim to improve Marion’s literacy rate by starting a program that partners with Marion Community Schools and other selected organizations. This program will encourage the city to volunteer time to read to children at selected organizations.
